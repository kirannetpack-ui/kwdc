## Architecture & System Overview

KTM-WDC coordinates five commercial logistics pillars across Nepal through a single integrated portal:
- **Commercial Warehousing**: Facility operators list verified space; enterprise shippers reserve, manage inventory via QR-coded boxes, and track warehouse tenures.
- **Freight Dispatch & Telemetry**: AI-assisted route calculation, multi-stop drop-offs, driver bidding/assignment, live GPS pinging, and digital proof-of-delivery (POD).
- **Heavy Equipment Rentals**: On-demand leasing for forklifts, pallet jacks, cranes, and certified operators with hourly/daily billing.
- **Licensed Security Agency Dispatch**: Perimeter surveillance, guard deployment, shift scheduling, and incident reporting.
- **AI Logistics Copilot**: Voice and text command processing for instant pickups, dispatch recommendations, pricing estimations, and reminder calendars.

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Laravel 12.x
- **PHP**: 8.2+ (tested up to PHP 8.3+)
- **Database**: SQLite (default for development/testing), PostgreSQL / MySQL ready
- **Styling**: Apple Cupertino Frosted Glassmorphism (`backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`), Tailwind CSS, Vanilla CSS
- **PDF & QR Engine**: `barryvdh/laravel-dompdf` (13% VAT Tax Invoices) + `simplesoftwareio/simple-qrcode`
- **WebSockets / Realtime**: `laravel/reverb` + Leaflet.js OpenStreetMap telemetry
- **AI Engine**: Gemini (`gemini-3.5-flash`), OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`), Groq (`mixtral`)

## Payment Suite & Financial Workflows

The portal supports both domestic Nepalese payment gateways and international card processing:

1. **Stripe Checkout (`payment.stripe.init`)**:
   - Supports Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Apple Pay, and Google Pay.
   - Handles multi-currency conversion, session validation, and webhook reconciliations.
2. **eSewa EPAY v2 (`payment.esewa.init`)**:
   - Direct payment initiation and callback verification via eSewa's transaction API.
   - Pre-configured with official UAT Sandbox credentials (`EPAYTEST`).
3. **Khalti v2 (`payment.khalti.init`)**:
   - Seamless checkout and lookup verification (`/epayment/lookup/`).
4. **Tax Invoicing & Reconciliation**:
   - Automatically calculates 13% Nepal Value Added Tax (VAT) and itemizes line items on official invoices.
   - Public QR verification endpoint at `/invoice/verify/{invoiceNumber}`.

---

## Legal & Statutory Liability Framework

The application is structured to provide full legal immunity and compliance under the laws of Nepal:

- **Muluki Civil Code (2074), Chapter 11 (Bailment / उपनिधान)**:
  - Establishes warehouse operators as legal bailees holding goods in trust.
  - Grants absolute immunity for Force Majeure / Acts of God (दैवी विपत्ति, floods, landslides, and highway blockades).
  - Enforces warehouse possessory lien rights and 60-day liquidation notices for abandoned cargo.
- **Motor Vehicles and Transport Management Act (2049)**:
  - Cabs carrier liability at **NPR 250 per kilogram** of actual damaged weight for standard consignments. High-value cargo must purchase supplementary commercial transit insurance prior to booking.
- **Electronic Transactions Act (2063)**:
  - Digital consent and click-wrap agreements are recognized as legally binding contracts in the courts of Nepal.
  - Mandatory terms acceptance checkboxes are enforced on User Registration, Dispatch Booking, and Pickup Requests.
- **Contraband Prohibitions**:
  - Strict zero-tolerance indemnity clauses prohibiting explosives, unmanifested narcotics, untaxed goods, and hazardous cargo.

## Account Banning & QR Code Revocation Framework

KTM-WDC incorporates military-grade security compliance controls to neutralize fraudulent actors and impound contraband cargo in real time:

### 1. Account Banning & Suspension
- **Administrative Control**: Admins can suspend any user account with a mandatory security justification (`POST /admin/users/{user}/ban` & `POST /admin/users/{user}/unban`).
- **Immediate Session Termination**: Authenticated sessions are immediately terminated upon banning via `EnsureAccountReady` middleware with an HTTP 403 suspension notice.
- **Login Defense**: Attempted logins with credentials belonging to banned accounts are rejected with an explicit suspension reason and contact directive.
- **Admin Immunity**: Self-banning safeguards prevent administrators from locking out administrative access.

### 2. QR Code Revocation (Invoices & Gate Passes)
- **Administrative Control**: Admins can revoke/ban invoice QR codes (`POST /admin/invoices/{invoice}/ban-qr` & `POST /admin/invoices/{invoice}/unban-qr`).
- **Public Tamper-Proof Verification**: Scanning or navigating to `/invoice/verify/{invoiceNumber}` immediately displays a high-visibility Apple Cupertino crimson alert card:
  - `🚨 QR CODE BANNED & REVOKED`
  - Statutory warning: Under Muluki Civil Code 2074, gate pass validation and cargo release are strictly prohibited.
  - Ban reason, audit timestamp, and security hotline.

### 3. Cargo Box & Parcel QR Impoundment
- **Box QR Revocation**: Admins can revoke box/parcel tracking QR codes (`POST /admin/boxes/{box}/ban-qr` & `POST /admin/boxes/{box}/unban-qr`).
- **Scannable QR Suppression**: `/boxes/{id}/qr` API nullifies active QR payload and returns `is_banned: true`.
- **Public Tracking Shield**: `/boxes/{id}/track` displays a bold red impoundment alert prohibiting cargo handoff.
- **Label Protection**: `/boxes/{id}/print` suppresses scannable QR generation and prints a high-contrast watermark: `VOID — CARGO RELEASE PROHIBITED`.

## Handover & Next Steps

This repository is in an **all-green, production-ready state**. Anyone taking over the codebase can immediately:
1. Clone and seed the database in under 3 minutes.
2. Log into all 6 role dashboards using the credentials in [Pre-Seeded Demo Credentials](#pre-seeded-demo-credentials).
3. Connect live merchant keys in `.env` to begin processing payments.
4. Run `php vendor/bin/phpunit` to verify full system integrity.
